What are the steps in breaking a monolith – into micro services?
Is it mandatory to have 1 microservice aligned to only 1 database or persistence
If there is a need to have 1 microservice to connect to multiple databases (or even multiple tables within a database) – will it be okay? Will we miss the loose coupling?
 
In a shopping ecommerce monolith application: if you need to cloudify what could be the steps
 
-          There are 3 main modules - Orders, shopping, inventory are key ones. There is a search which operates on all the 3 modules
-          Will you create a search microservice? How does it work?
-          How does authentication work if you are using an Active Directory (for internal users) and if you need to cloudify?
